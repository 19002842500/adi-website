        Hi my love (˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶) <br> 
        This is just about from yesterday and I also want to show you what I meant about making a website for you but not
        an actual website (not published website) okay? <br>
        I'm so bad at making a whole paraghraph or letters and stuff, I'm not used to any of these AHHH but here I 
        am trying my very best for you, I want to show you how much you mean to me, nah this is nothing I swear, I can do better than this. Let
        me show you how I really love a person (YOU) let me show you that you are worth it, you are enough and is more than enough, let me show
        you how serious I am about the stuff I said to you, let me prove to you that I'm down bad for you. <br>
        You don't know how happy I was with you yesterday, the whole day I was just smiling, grateful and I could feel that my love for you just keep
        on growing. Though I am scared of losing you one day but nah, I'll just focus on today and stop thinking about the negative thoughts. <br>
        Looking deeply into your eyes, I feel so calm, and at peace. A peace I've never experience before. HAHAHAHA writing this while pranking you I'm
        not fine is Crazyyy, I'm sorry my love I have to do this (੭˃ᴗ˂)੭ <br>
        Alright let me finish what I want to say (｡>﹏<)<br>
        Loving you is very easy, loving you and taking care of you is easy. I don't know why those people treated you badly ( •̀_•́ ) but its okay my love,
        you are safe with me, your heart and soul is safe with me ♡ <br>
        I'll give you my all, I'd trade everything for you just to see that smile of yours. And I'd give you the last bite of my hash brown THATS HOW I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.<br>
        Now I remember how dumb and happy we were yesterday, actually I was cracking up because of us just doing some random stuff, and not you pushing
        the trolley LMAO. We were the spotlight yesterday HAHAHAHA people were staring at us and they were smiling (˶ˆ꒳ˆ˵) And I'm just happy and all giddy
        because I felt like a princess that time (๑˃̵ᴗ˂̵)و <br>
        You made me the very happy and lucky girl in the whole universe (≧∇≦) <br>
        When we were watching the movie too, I was in aww the whole time cause you literally watch a whole filo movie for me and my fam (˶ˆ꒳ˆ˵) <br>
